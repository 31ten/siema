# Siema - Lightweight and simple carousel in pure JavaScript

Creating another grid system or carousel framework sounds like a stupid idea? I did it! Crazy lightweight (just 1kb  gziped), no dependencies and no styling. As Brad Frost said once "do that shit yourself". If you need some more powerful library I recommend <a href="http://flickity.metafizzy.co/">Flickity</a> by David DeSandro or <a href="http://idangero.us/swiper/">Swiper</a> by iDangero team. By the way - I built a <a href="https://pawelgrzybek.com/do-you-really-need-another-grid-system/">grid system</a> too :)

## To do:

- Link Github page from description
- Test cross browser
- Add and info about supported browsers
- Video of using with yarn / npm
